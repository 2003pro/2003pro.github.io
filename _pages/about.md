Currently, I am a Ph.D candidate at [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](http://www.scse.uestc.edu.cn), CSE, advised by [Prof.Tong Zhang](http://tongzhang-ml.org/). I got my M.Sc degress in School of Computer Science and Engineering from  [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/) in June 2021. Before that, I finished my B.Sc. degree in the School of Mathematical Science from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in June 2018. 
    Right now, my main research interest lies in Large Language Model techniques and Multi-Modal Pre-Training.
